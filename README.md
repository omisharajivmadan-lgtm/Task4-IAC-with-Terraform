# Task 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

This repository contains the submission for DevOps Internship Task 4.

**Objective:** Provision a local Docker container using Terraform.

## Tools Used

* **Terraform**
* **Docker**

## File Structure

This repository is organized using Terraform best practices:

* `main.tf`: Contains the primary resource definitions (the Docker image and container).
* `variables.tf`: Declares input variables (like `image_name`) to make the configuration reusable.
* `outputs.tf`: Defines outputs to display useful information after provisioning (like the Container ID).
* `.gitignore`: Prevents Terraform state files (`.tfstate`) and local directories (`.terraform`) from being committed.

## System Architecture

This diagram shows the flow of control, from the user's command to the final running container.

## Execution Steps & Logs

Here is the complete lifecycle of the Terraform configuration, from initialization to destruction.

### 1. `terraform init`

Initializes the working directory, downloading the Docker provider.

#### Output:
```shell
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding kreuzwerker/docker versions matching "~> 3.0.1"...
- Installing kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2...
- Installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2 (self-signed, key ID BD080C4571C6104C)
Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/plugins/signing
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

### 2. `terraform plan`

Creates an execution plan to preview the changes. This step shows that one image will be pulled and one container will be created.

#### Output:
```shell
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx_container will be created
  + resource "docker_container" "nginx_container" {
      + attach                                      = false

### 3. `terraform apply`

Applies the plan to create the resources.

#### Output

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:

### 4. Verification (`docker ps`)

After applying, I verified the container was running using docker ps.

#### Output
```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES

```

### 5. `terraform state list`

This command lists all resources tracked in the Terraform state file.

#### Output
```shell
docker_container.nginx_container
docker_image.nginx
```
![alt text](image-4.png)

### 6. `terraform destroy`

Tears down all managed resources, destroying the container.

#### Output
```shell
docker_image.nginx: Refreshing state... [id=sha256:029d4461bd98f124e531380505ceea2072418fdf28752aa73b7b273ba3048903nginx:latest]
